   Question: what are static methods? why do we need them?
 */

//Answer

/**
// * What is static methods
 * The static keyword is used to create methods that will exist independently of any instances created for the class.
 * Static methods do not use any instance variables of any object of the class they are defined in.
 *
// * Why do we need them?
 * To access methods directly we use static methods.
 * We can call other static methods inside another static methods.
 * We can access static methods directly inside a non static methods.
 * We can only access a static variables inside a static function.
 * We can also access static methods inside a static block.
 * Static methods cannot be overridden , but static methods can be overloaded.
 * We can directly access the methods from a class, by defining classname followed by dot operator with method name.
